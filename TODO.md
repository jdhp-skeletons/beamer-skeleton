# TODO

## Skeleton

- [ ] Add a makefile in "figs/" to make/clean figures from scripts (Python,
      ...)
- [ ] Make a snippets document in a dedicated git repository
- [ ] Update the French version
- [ ] Use git-submodules for logos (figs/logos/) (institutions, CC, ...),
      bibliography (bibliography/), ... + init them in init_skeleton.sh
- [ ] Add an HTML target (see
      http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25309/how-do-i-convert-a-beamer-based-latex-file-to-html)
      with improved CSS
- [ ] Add Disqus (or equivalent) in generated HTML pages

- [ ] Improve the init_skeleton.sh script (add safety checks: are the variable
      defined ? is the skeleton branch already exist ? ...)
- [ ] For HTML target, put CSS in a dedicated file (in "style/html/" like the
      rst-skeleton)
- [ ] For HTML target, improve SEO ?
    - [ ] Add HTML meta tags: author/subject/keywords/...
- [ ] Thought about figs/logos: it is copied for each document in
      www.jdhp.org/docs/ (waste of space)
- [ ] Is the HTML document compliant with mobile devices (see Google's
      advices) ?
